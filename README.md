<h3>Implment Ceaser Cipher.</h3>
 <p> > This Python code implements a command-line tool for encrypting and decrypting messages using the Caesar cipher technique. It prompts the user for their choice of operation (encryption or decryption), the message, and a key for shifting characters, then displays the result.</p>
<h3>How It Works:</h3>
<p>The implementation consists of a main function that handles user input in a loop. It checks for valid options, reads the message and key, and calls a caeser function (assumed to be defined elsewhere) to perform the encryption or decryption based on the user's choice. The loop continues until the user opts not to process another message.</p>
